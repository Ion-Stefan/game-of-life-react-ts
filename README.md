React Conway's Game of Life
Overview
Welcome to the React Conway's Game of Life project! This project is a recreation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton, using React with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from humans.
